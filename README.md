This is a simple ruby/bash script set I made to host a photo album as a static hosted website in aws s3.

You just have to put your photo files in a folders like `albuns/album1/`, `albuns/album2/` etc folders, put your bucket name in `sync.sh` and call it to sync up.

(You'll need to install rmagick gem.)
